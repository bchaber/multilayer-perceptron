# Multilayer Perceptron

A (hopefully!) simple two-layer perceptron with backpropagation of errors.

# Motivation

Did it as a way of learning implementation details and challanges of training neural networks.
This simple example allows to explore the relationship between neural networks a simple least mean square approximation.
